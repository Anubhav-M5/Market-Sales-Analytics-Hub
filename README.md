# Market-Sales-Analytics-Hub
This project is about building a simple and user-friendly web app called Market Sales Analytics Hub. It helps users explore and understand their market sales data—even if they don’t know programming. The app is made using Streamlit and uses powerful tools like Pandas, Plotly, and DuckDB to manage data and create visual reports.

Users can upload CSV files with sales data. After uploading, they can quickly see important sales metrics, find trends, and make custom charts and graphs. The app also has interactive filters to focus on specific time periods, product types, or regions.

A key feature is the SQL query option, where users can run SQL commands directly on their uploaded data using a simple interface. They can also download automated reports in PDF or CSV formats to share insights easily.

There’s a storytelling module that guides users through their data step by step, pointing out key patterns. For deeper insights, a what-if analysis tool lets them try different business scenarios. To make it more fun, the app even includes a data trivia game.
